Goal:
Convert predicted masks into clean CAD-like geometry.

Steps:
- extract contours
- simplify polylines
- orthogonal snapping
- wall centerline extraction
- door/window segment extraction
- room polygon closure

Acceptance Criteria:
- Produces vector primitives from predicted masks.
- Saves intermediate debug visuals.
